# 10-Team_Profile_Generator
We will be creating a node.js team profile generator.  

## Description
This project was to use Node.js to create a formatted Team Profile.  Each employee will have a generated card with their information.  We used npm jest to make sure the test functions worked.  The HTML is styled with Bootstrap and CSS.

## Utilize Project
To run this project, open up the Integrated Terminal.  You can run the npm test to run all four test for the different types of Employees.  Then you can type node index.js to start the Team Profile Generator.  Answer the series of questions, then note different employee inputs that will be added.  The questions of name, email and id will be the same for all employees.  A Manager will be asked for an office number.  An Engineer will be asked for their GitHub username, and the Intern is asked what school they attend.  If there are no more employees to add, the Team Profile is then generated in the file data.html.
